    msg: "You weren't just an English teacher, you were my idol. Every lesson you gave, every word you spoke, and every smile you shared painted inspiration across my journey. Whenever I think, write, read, listen, or speak in English, I think of you. You sparked a fire of curiosity in me that I never knew existed. You patiently guided me through challenges, celebrated every small victory, and made learning feel like an adventure rather than a task. You didn’t just teach me language—you taught me confidence, persistence, and the joy of discovery. I can't even thank you enough; all this happened because of you. You drew a smile on my face when days seemed gray and showed me that passion, dedication, and heart can create miracles. From your grateful student, Hussein Ayed. ",
